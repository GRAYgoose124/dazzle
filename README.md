# Dazzle  ðŸš§ Under Construction ðŸš§

> Dazzle is a docker-compose system for deploying a Django website frontend for [dizzy](https://github.com/GRAYgoose124/dizzy).


Loosely speaking, one makes a request to a backend library with a custom dizzy wrapper. The web uses a `dizzy.daemon.Client` to substantiate this interaction. `compute/data/.dizzy` holds the information and python code for the custom dizzy protocol. See dizzy itself to learn more about customizing dizzy protocols.

S/N: Dizzy itself is very incomplete. [Zmqer](https://github.com/GRAYgoose124/zmqueer) is a similar experiment which I may merge in achieving RPC-like behaviour with zmq through dizzy.


## Install and Run
```bash
    # Init git submodules
    git submodule update --init --recursive
    
    # If you want to access it from anything other than localhost, set the primary host in:
    cp .env.template .env

    ./run.sh [-h]
```

### Useful vars
```bash
FORCE_NO_CACHE=True ./run.sh -b
SELECTED_EXTRA_BASE=${pytorch:cuda} ./run.sh -b
```

Then in your browser:

    localhost/dizzy?entity=einz&workflow=einzy

Or, to browse the website, simply:

    localhost

Check images/compute/data/.dizzy for project-specific dizzy files.

### Production
    Set DJANGO_PRIMARY_HOST

    DJANGO_SECRET_KEY=YOURSECRETKEY ./run -p

## TODO:
- [ ] In production we may want to remove the /app volumes and instead COPY the /image/x/appfolders into the container.
- [ ] automatic python manage.py 
  - [ ] collectstatic
  - [ ] migrate
- [ ] test `-b`, `-b -g`, `SELECTED_EXTRA_BASE=${pytorch:cuda}` etc.
